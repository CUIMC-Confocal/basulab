  Extract the sample name, omitting the number and extension. Click Update here and confirm that the correct name is saved.

[   3] [NamesAndTypes]
  Click Update here to verify that the images are correctly detected.

[   4] [Groups]
  No need to do anything here.

[   5] [ColorToGray]
  Split the channels. We assume that the 1st channel is PLA and the 2nd is DAPI.

[   6] [IdentifyPrimaryObjects]
  Identify nuclei in the DAPI channel.

[   7] [IdentifyPrimaryObjects]
  Identify PLA spots as objects.  This is one of 2 ways to find the spots. Feel free to use the method that is more accurate for your images.

[   8] [FindMaxima]
  Identify PLA spots as local maxima (peaks of intensity). This tends to perform better in lower-intensity areas. Feel free to use whichever method that is more accurate for your images.

[   9] [IdentifyPrimaryObjects]
  Convert the local maxima into objects.

[  10] [RelateObjects]
  Associate PLA spots (primary object method) with nuclei. We are counting only the spots in or touching the edge of the nuclei. 

[  11] [RelateObjects]
  Associate PLA spots (local maxima method) with nuclei. We are counting only the spots in or touching the edge of the nuclei.

[  12] [ExportToSpreadsheet]
  Export data to spreadsheets.

[  13] [GrayToColor]
  Create an overlay image to show the detected nuclei and PLA spots. The Maxima are shown in green.

[  14] [OverlayOutlines]
  Add the outlines of the detected nuclei and PLA primary objects.

[  15] [SaveImages]
  Save the overlay image. Use this image to evaluate the accuracy of detection.
